            <h1>My Academic Journey</h1>
            <p class="intro">My academic journey began at Joy Blessed Stars Primary School, where I developed a strong foundation in learning. I later joined Kiereini Boys High School, where I actively participated in various academic and extracurricular activities. I had a keen interest in mathematics, which earned me a certificate for participating in a math contest. Throughout my education, I have embraced learning as a continuous process, and I am now expanding my knowledge in IT at Zetech University.

                <h3>Diploma - Zetech University (2024)</h3>
                <h3>Certificate - Zetech University (2022)</h3>
                <p>Diploma in Information Technology – Zetech University (2024)
                    This program provided a solid foundation in software development, database management, networking, and system analysis. I gained hands-on experience in Java, web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and database design. A key part of my diploma was working on a project, where I developed a sales platform for men's grooming products, applying my technical knowledge to solve real-world problems.</p>
                <p>Certificate in Information Technology – Zetech University (2022)
                    The certificate program introduced me to basic programming, computer systems, networking fundamentals, and database concepts. This course helped me build essential IT skills and prepared me for further studies in software development and system implementation.</p>

                <p>Football Team - Player (Kiereini Boys High School, 2019-2022)
                    As a member of the high school football team, I actively participated in training sessions, team strategies, and competitive matches. My role involved improving my stamina, teamwork, and leadership skills while competing at the school and inter-school levels. Through football, I learned the importance of discipline, resilience, and strategic thinking, which have positively influenced my personal and professional growth.</p>
                    
                    <p>Basketball Team - Player (Kiereini Boys High School, 2021-2022)
                    Being part of the basketball team allowed me to enhance my coordination, agility, and tactical decision-making. I played a crucial role in both offensive and defensive plays, contributing to the team’s overall performance. This experience taught me teamwork, quick problem-solving, and adaptability under pressure, qualities that are valuable in both sports and the tech industry.</p>

                <h3>Notable Learning Experience</h3>
                <p>As part of my diploma, I developed a sales platform for men's grooming products, which allowed me to apply my coding and database management skills in a real-world scenario. Throughout this project, I was guided by my mentors, Madam Hellen and Mr. Boniface, who provided valuable insights and helped me refine my technical and project management abilities. This experience further fueled my passion for software development and entrepreneurship.</p>
